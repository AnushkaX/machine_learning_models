# Classification Models

This repository is consists with a Google Colab script which I used to classify my research dataset.

The research was done to find the user preferences on various color palettes on websites.

Dataset was created after a survey and the survey was done with the help of a [Google Form.](https://forms.gle/ksohiW2fPNve7rD48) 

In this script you can find the codes for,

  1. Random Over Sampling using "imbalanced-learn" library. [Documentation](https://imbalanced-learn.org/)
  2. Dataset manipulation using "scikit-learn" library. [Documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
  3. Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classifier package of scikit-learn library.
  4. Decision Tree Classifier of scikit-learn library.
      - Printing Decision Tree in textual format
      - Printing Decision Tree in graphical format
  5. Naive Bayes Classifier
      - Gaussian Naive Bayes
      - Categorical Naive Bayes
  6. XGBoost Classifier
      - Printing Tree in graphical format
  7. Random Forest Classifier

**Required datasets are uploaded to this repository itself. Feel free to contact me for any references.**
